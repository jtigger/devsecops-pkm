	- > FWIW, part of these problems come about where people implement operators where things created by the custom resource will only be deleted if the operator gets a chance to run on notification that the custom resource was deleted. If however the operator was itself part of what was being deployed by an overall package, the operator may have been already deleted and so can't do that, which will be a problem if the resources are in a namespace kapp is trying to delete as it blocks things. It is better in my opinion not to rely on delete actions by operators when all it is doing is deleting the resources. Instead, when creating those resources set owner references from the resources back to the custom resource object instance. That way deleting the custom resource deletion will automatically trigger the deletion of the resources created from it and the operator doesn't have to get involved. Anyway, possibly nothing to do with this specific case, but that's my rant on the subject.
