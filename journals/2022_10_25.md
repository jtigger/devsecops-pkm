- # GitOpsCon Notes
	- ## Welcome
	  collapsed:: true
		- GitOps WG
		- Went over the principles, but I didn't hear anything insightful past what's been shared.
			- Declarative
			- Versioned and Immutable
			- Pulled Automatically
			- Continuously Reconciled
		- What's it mean to be "GitOps Certified"?
	- ## Keynote
	  collapsed:: true
		- It all starts with declarative configuration
		- Then we have to automate all the work required to produce the "declared config" and dependencies.
		- Then came CRDs
			- with their Operator Framework
			- example: Kafka
		- And stuff like Crossplane
			- for instantiating resources outside the cluster
- Chats w/ Paul
	- CUE heading to v1
		- taking on some breaking fixes
			- cue fmt
				- not just for command-line but embedded
	- How do you patch?
		- Paul: deliberately:

- ## Our Journey in Integrating GitOps Tools Into Delivery Pipelines
  collapsed:: true

	- Keptn + GitOps Tools
		- ArgoCD to detect change and kickoff GitOps workflow
		- Keptn for deployment workflow
			- includes the Keptn Lifecycle Controller
				- works with default k8s config
				- add a few annotations
					- "use Argo, Flux, etc. for that"
				- Monitors the execution of the workflow and provides "observability" (via OpenTelementry)
				- Can do pre-deployment checks (e.g. resource checks)
				- "Standard Task Execution" (via "function" or Containers)
				- Adds additional hooks: "App-Pre-Deploy" and "App-Post-Deploy", etc.
		-
	- Scaling
		- "GitOps Tools" can scale up well.
	- Challenges:
		- does attempt to support Blue/Green deployments / "Progressive Delivery"
			- do that with ArgoCD or FluxCD.
	- Q: can all the observability data that Keptn collects, does it make it available to the CI/CD tool (like ArgoCD)

	- How to bootstrap a cluster of clusters?
	- Desired State vs. Actual State vs. Observed State
		- How do you state "desired state" in a "progressive delivery"
		- What about articulating your "desired state" in part in terms of SLOs?
		- differences in Deployment "replicas" are not considered drift (aka K8s)
		- Status vs. Conditions
			- How these are
			- Victor: "Ready for" ... what?

	- Humantic Presentation: DevOps is Dead
		- this concept resonates and is similar to the “platform team” described in “Team topologies” - see https://youtu.be/haejb5rzKsM
