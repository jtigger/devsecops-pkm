- Created [[RBAC]]
	- exploring the space around how Carvel `App` resources are dependent on their `ServiceAccount` (and `Role` and `RoleBinding`) in order to delete.
		- Problem was that when someone deleted a `Namespace` that contained a Carvel `App`
			- all the resources would get marked for deletion immediately
			- this includes the `ServiceAccount` and associated resources
			-
	- trying to better understand how ServiceAccounts and RBAC work.
