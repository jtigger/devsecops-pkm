- EKS = Managed [[Kubernetes]].
	- Random Facts
		- Support encrypting secrets with KMS.
- KMS = Key Management Service
	- These are your _encryption keys_ not your encrypted data.
		- they are _used_ by other services to perform encryption.
		-
	- FIPS 140-2 validated hardware
	  collapsed:: true
		- https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf
		- FIPS = Federal Information Processing Standard
		- Security Level 1
			- No physical security required
			- Can run on a general purpose compute (on an unevaluated OS)
			- e.g. PC encryption board
		- Security Level 2
			- Must have tamper-evident coating (on locks and doors)
			- Must have Role-Based authentication
			- Can run on general purpose compute, but must be EAL2 (or higher)
		- Security Level 3
		  id:: 63ba10e3-db0d-49a6-a2d9-56d031a2c9b1
			- Must be in a strong enclosure
			- Must zero-out plaintext CSP when doors/covers are opened/removed
			- Must use Identity-based authentication
		- Security Level 4
			- Must zero-out plaintext CSP when _any_ unauthorized access is attempted, or if the device is used outside of normal operating voltages or temperatures
	- There are multiple key source options
		- KMS, itself
		- CloudHSM (Hardware Security Module) â€” FIPS 104-2, ((63ba10e3-db0d-49a6-a2d9-56d031a2c9b1)) validated
			- This is a _cluster_ of hardware modules
