		- SealedSecrets
		  collapsed:: true
			- Flow:
				- User's Laptop
					- (secret manifest) => `kubeseal` => (SealedSecret manifest) => git repo (special for secrets)
				- In Cluster
					- git repo => SealedSecret -names and owns-> Secret
					- SealedSecretsController (+Decryption keys +SealedSecret) =(creates)=> Secret
			- Usage:
				- POC or quick starts
				- doesn't scale well
		- ArgoCD Vault Plugin
		  collapsed:: true
			- Problem: you can't scope how widely secrets are shared
		- SOPS
			- "There are so many problems, we don't have time"
			- Problem: you can't scope how widely secrets are shared
		- Vault Agent Injector
		  collapsed:: true
			- Flow:
				- Annotate your Pod manifests with Vault annotations
				- Sidecar Injector Controller
					- injects the "vault agent" sidecar
						- telling agent
						- mounts `/vault/secrets` and places
			- Problem: each pod gets its own injector, which itself connects to the Vault server; might not scale.
		- Secrets Store CSI
		  collapsed:: true
			- Summary: secrets injected directly into Pod through the Container Storage Interface.
			- Flow:
				- in `kube-system` namespace, create a `SecretProviderClass` to describe where secret data comes from.
				- when your Pod is created, the CSI Driver mounts `/mnt/secrets` and pulls configured secrets from various secret managers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vault)
		- External Secrets Operator
		  collapsed:: true
			- Summary:
			- Flow:
				- Setup In Cluster
					- create `ClusterSecretStore` that describes how to get secrets
					- `ExternalSecretsController` takes that configuration and adapts to various secrets managers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vault, ...)
				- Workstation
					- include an `ExternalSecret` in your manifests.
				- Runtime
					- `ExternalSecretsController`, for every `ExternalSecrets` creates and updates a `Secret`.
